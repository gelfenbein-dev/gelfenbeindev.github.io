		My name is Moriya Gelfenbein and I am a first-year undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin. My hometown is Burlington, Vermont but I grew up in Ashland Oregon. Ever since I was young I have been fascinated with fashion. As a toddler, I would love to mix and match bright colors and textures. Although my style has become simpler over the years my creativity has never waned. As I have gotten older, traveled, and been exposed to more media I have found myself continuously analyzing styles and trends. I have always drawn inspiration from those around me and have a strong appreciation for people who express themselves through the clothes they wear. In middle school and high school, I got extremely into thrifting and used that as an outlet to find my personal style. As I move through the world I have a critiquing eye for clothing items and the message they send. For this project, I wanted to reflect my love for fashion through UW Madison students themselves. With these images, I am also able to showcase both my interest in fashion and photography. I hope you enjoy the pieces I loved.
